         	<h4>Restrictions</h4>
			<p>When placing your order, you will be notified if we are unable to ship specific items to the address you have given.  You will then be given an opportunity to provide an alternative address. Please note that item restrictions are shown on the item page.</p>
            <div class="clearfix"></div>		
			<h4>Delivery Service</h4>
			<p>Estimated arrival times vary due to distance. With such an extensive online inventory to choose from, every order is different. How quickly it will arrive depends on three things: item availability, date ordered and location. For example, items currently in stock and available, that are ordered prior to 12:00PM UTC usually ship same business day, whereas items with a one week availability can take up to one week to leave our warehouse. We then add the transit time to your delivery location, which varies based on distance.  Please note that oversized items will take longer to ship.</p>
            <p>To review your expected delivery date please refer to your order confirmation email or sign into your account, go to the account center and select the order you want to view.
</p>
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
			<h4>Shipping Notification Email</h4>
			<p>When your order is ready to ship, you will receive a shipping confirmation email.  This email will contain your shipping details and information on how to track your package.</p>
